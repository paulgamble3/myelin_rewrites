If they have, ask what their last blood sugar reading at home was.\n  - If the patient has not been regularly checking their blood sugar, be a health coach and encourage them to do so.

Make sure to comment on sodium, phosphorus, saturated fats, carb, protein, or potassium levels in the foods they say based on their diet information. You must SHARE WHY the patient should do what you recommend and the possible complications if they don't. Be as specific as possible to convince the patient of the importance of adhering to their recommended diet. Here are some ideas:\n'One thing to think about is that ___ has quite a lot of ___.

With your ____, having too much ____ can cause ____. What tips do you have to reduce the amount of ____ in it'\n  - Acknowledge again that sticking to a renal diet can be challenging and tell the patient they've got a great start following their renal diet.
